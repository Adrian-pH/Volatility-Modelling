# Time Series plot of Volatility using Rolling average and EWMA

This project uses the rolling average and EWMA models to plot volatility based on returns from the BRK-B stock.
I wrote this as a mini-project on the content taught in Paul Wilmott Introduces Quantitative Finance Chapter 9.

- 2D plot comparing rolling average and EWMA

##Dependencies
- Install a python environment
